# Academic Honesty Statement

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is a cornerstone of our educational community. As a student in this course, you are expected to 
uphold the highest standards of academic integrity, which includes but is not limited to:

## Coding Assignments

1. **Original Code:** All code submitted for assignments must be your own original work. 
Copying code from fellow students, past solutions, public repositories (such as GitHub), or any other source is strictly 
prohibited.

2. **Attribution:** If you use non-essential code snippets from external sources, such as external utilities that are not 
essential for solving the assignment, you must provide clear attribution to the source and indicate that these code snippets 
are not integral to your solution. Failure to attribute non-essential external code properly is considered plagiarism.

3. **Collaboration:** While collaboration is encouraged for discussions and understanding concepts, each student must 
submit their own unique solution.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism, which includes presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own, is a serious breach of academic 
integrity. This extends to written assignments, code, diagrams, and any other form of intellectual property.

## Usage of LLMs (Large Language Models)

While LLMs can be valuable tools for research and learning, using them to generate code or written assignments without 
substantial personal contribution is not allowed. LLMs should be used as aids, not substitutes for your own work.

## Consequences of Academic Dishonesty

Violations of academic integrity will not be tolerated and may result in serious consequences, including but not limited to:

- A failing grade for the assignment.
- A failing grade for the course.
- Referral to the Department's Council for further action, which may include suspension or expulsion from the University.
